"""
Unit tests for the plugin manager in the CLI calculator application.

These tests verify the dynamic loading and error handling of plugins. The plugin manager
is responsible for loading commands such as 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 
'menu', and 'exit' from dynamically imported plugin modules. These tests ensure the 
correct behavior of the plugin manager under various scenarios, including successful 
plugin loading, handling missing plugins, and error handling when a plugin fails to load.
